<p> Here is a bar graph made from the word frequencies. To get this graph, I first 
read in a piece of text into thonny. Then, I used the list of ten common words and
compared them to the piece of text using a counter and for loops. After that, I used
this list of the frequencies along with the list of common words to make a bar graph.</p>
