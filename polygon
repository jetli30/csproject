<p> Here is a polygon constructed from word frequencies. TO get this polygon, I first
calculated the average of the word frequencies. Then, using this number, I calculated
the sum of the internal angles of the shape and then divided this by the number of angles
to find the measure of each individual angle. Now, I could use turtle to construct a regular
polygon since I knew how many sides the shape will have and the measure of each angle. </p>
